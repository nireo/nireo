Currently using [arch](https://archlinux.org/), [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and [emacs](https://github.com/nireo/.emacs.d).
For languages I use Go primarily, but also like Typescript and C/C++. I'm working on public and private projects. The private projects will be published when I'm ready with them.
